This cherry based kombucha will blow your taste buds. The sweet cherry will bring a burst of tartness to the kombucha drinker. The cherry has a light honey flavor. As the cherry has so much sugar in it, it's best to keep it light in flavor. Personally I'd keep the cherry flavor on the light side. I'd mix it into a homemade soda. You can also add a little vanilla to enhance the taste of the kombucha. Either way, you'll love the taste of this kombucha.
