Asparagus is a unique type of kombucha. That's because, in contrast to other kombuchas, a majority of the liquid (but not all) actually comes from the kombucha fermentation. That means you get a softer, rounder flavor in Asparagus. This beverage is very good for you, and a great way to spice up your drinking routine. It is the closest drink to the elixir of life. Try it, you won't regret it!
