One of our most popular kombucha is the strawberry one. It uses strawberries from our farm, which are canned on our farm. It is also 100% organic, and comes in a perfect size bottle for a very fair price. The strawberry kombucha is full of strawberries and also uses high quality fermentation microbes. The consistency is similar to a fruit smoothie. For more information about the strawberry kombucha feel free to contact Kalle. Order your strawberry kombucha from our website. It is guaranteed that you are going to love it.
